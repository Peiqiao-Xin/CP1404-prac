# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My initial estimates were about 50% off but improved to within 10% by mid-semester.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I learned to break tasks into smaller steps and factor in testing time, which made my later estimates much closer.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I realized that buffer time is essential and that I tend to underestimate debugging effort.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I discovered more Pythonic idioms (e.g. list comprehensions) and better docstring practices.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others helped me spot edge cases and improved my ability to write clear, testable code.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[PR #12 on recursion practical](https://github.com/yourrepo/recursion/pull/12)

### Explanation

I suggested adding boundary checks and example doctests, which prevented runtime errors.

### Good Code Review 2

[PR #8 on testing practical](https://github.com/yourrepo/testing/pull/8)


### Explanation

I recommended using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to simplify multiple test cases, reducing code duplication.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add a mid-practical checkpoint for peer-pair programming to catch issues early.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently wrote clear docstrings and automated tests that covered edge cases.
