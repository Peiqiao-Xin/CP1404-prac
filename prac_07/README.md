# Practical 07
Welcome to my CP1404 practicals repository. This repository contains all lab exercises, sample code, and data files for the course. Each practical is organized in its own folder (e.g., prac_07) and follows the standard workflow: create a feature branch, submit a pull request, request a code review, merge, and update the master branch.

About Me

I am Peiqiao Xin, a student at James Cook University. Through these practicals, I have enhanced my Python programming skills and embraced clean code principles alongside version control best practices.

Key Lessons on Clean Code

Meaningful Naming: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes; adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Comprehensive Documentation: Provide concise docstrings for each function and class to improve readability and maintainability.

Modular Design: Break functionality into independent modules (functions and classes) to facilitate testing, reuse, and separation of concerns.
