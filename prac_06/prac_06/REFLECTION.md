# Practical 06 Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I have started planning my code structure before writing it and writing helper methods earlier. I’ve also used more comments and docstrings.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I need to improve time management. I tend to start late and rush toward the deadline. I will plan to work at least 2 days earlier.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I write neat and well-formatted code, and I’m consistent in using good naming conventions and modular design.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to avoid repeating mistakes from earlier weeks, such as forgetting to test edge cases.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
It would be helpful to have short video examples for each practical, to visually explain tricky parts of the tasks.
